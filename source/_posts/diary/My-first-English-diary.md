Hi.
This is my first English log. 
Now, I’m learning English every day, But my English level is poor. 
If I want to go abroad,I must to learn more English and improve my English level. 
I’m have been learning English for a year,but My English so bad yet, because I never spend more time to learn it,I’ve been spend more to play these video games on my Switch. 
Now,I don’t have more time,I only have four months to prepare my IELTS. 
Come!Do it!Don’t waste my time to play game!If I get a nice IELTS,I can spend even more time to play these games!
This is a nice start, I’ll record my process of learning for English at here. 
Go get it!I trust me,I can do it!
